## Technical Notes / Assumptions

- **IRPEF Brackets** (2026 Italian rates assumed):

  + 23% up to €28,000

  + 33% from €28,001 to €50,000

  + 43% above €50,000

- **Employee contribution rates**:

  + 9.49% for companies ≥ 15 employees

  + 9.19% for companies < 15 employees

- **Regional and municipal tax rates**:

  + Default: 2% regional, 0.8% municipal

  + Can be customized per user input

- **Main tax credit -> _detrazione lavoro dipendente_** (dependent on taxable income):

  + Up to €15,000 -> €1,955

  + €15,001–28,000 -> linear reduction

  + €28,001–50,000 -> further reduction

  + €50,000 -> €0

- **Further tax credits** 
  
  + **_Ulteriori detrazioni_** applied for certain RAL ranges, e.g. €1,000 for €20,000 to €32,000
  
    * N.B. When searching sources for detailed explanations on which quantity these credits are based upon - whether it is total _imponibile IRPEF_ or total RAL - I found nothing that could dispel any doubts. For this reason, I decided to use RAL, given that the application of such tax credits produces a jumpy RAL-net salary curve anyway.

  + **_Bonus cuneo fiscale_** included for RAL ≤ €20,000.
  
    * N.B. In this case, I used RAL with a bit more confidence that the calculation is based upon it, given what I found in online sources.

- **Fiscal benefit (e.g. “rientro dei cervelli”)**: user can specify percentage of taxable income exempt from IRPEF.

**Note**: All computations are simplified approximations for demo purposes. Real-world payroll calculations may involve additional factors like pension schemes, company-specific benefits, or deductions.
